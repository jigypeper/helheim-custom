The *compile-angel* package **speeds up Emacs by ensuring that all Elisp libraries are both byte-compiled and native-compiled**:
- Byte compilation reduces the overhead of loading Emacs Lisp code at runtime.
- Native compilation improves performance by generating machine code that runs directly on the hardware, leveraging the full capabilities of the host CPU. The actual speedup varies with the characteristics of the Lisp code, but it is typically 2.5 to 5 times faster than the equivalent byte-compiled version.

For users looking to ensure a fully optimized environment, the compile-angel package is a valuable addition to the native compilation workflow. Integrating compile-angel guarantees that every .el file in your load path, including your own configuration and manually managed .el files, is properly byte and natively compiled. This ensures a consistent performance boost across the entire editor.

This package offers:
- `(compile-angel-on-load-mode)`: A global mode that compiles .el files when they are loaded.
- `(compile-angel-on-save-local-mode)`: A local mode that compiles .el files whenever the user saves them.

If this package enhances your workflow, please show your support by **⭐ starring compile-angel on GitHub** to help more users discover its benefits.

## Why use compile-angel?

Because you are likely running a significant amount of interpreted, slow Elisp code that Emacs did not compile automatically. Ensuring that Elisp is native-compiled significantly improves Emacs' performance. Unfortunately, functions like *package-install* and *package-recompile-all* do not compile .el files that were not installed using *package.el*. Since these files are not byte-compiled, the Emacs JIT compiler does not native-compile them either, as a byte-compiled file signals the JIT compiler to perform native compilation. **In contrast, **compile-angel** modes ensure that all loaded `.el` files are compiled transparently, regardless of whether they are part of a package.**

## Installation of compile-angel

### Emacs

To install *compile-angel* on Emacs from MELPA:

1. If you haven't already done so, [add MELPA repository to your Emacs configuration](https://melpa.org/#/getting-started).

2. Add the following code to your init file:
```emacs-lisp
;; Ensure Emacs loads the most recent byte-compiled files.
(setq load-prefer-newer t)

(use-package compile-angel
  :config
  ;; Set `compile-angel-verbose' to nil to disable compile-angel messages.
  ;; (When set to nil, compile-angel won't show which file is being compiled.)
  (setq compile-angel-verbose t)

  ;; Uncomment the line below to compile automatically when an Elisp file is saved
  ;; (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook #'compile-angel-on-save-local-mode)

  ;; The following directive prevents compile-angel from compiling your init
  ;; files. If you choose to remove this push to `compile-angel-excluded-path-suffixes'
  ;; and compile your pre/post-init files, ensure you understand the
  ;; implications and thoroughly test your code. For example, if you're using
  ;; the `use-package' macro, you'll need to explicitly add:
  ;; (eval-when-compile (require 'use-package))
  ;; at the top of your init file.
  (push "/init.el" compile-angel-excluded-path-suffixes)
  (push "/early-init.el" compile-angel-excluded-path-suffixes)

  ;; A global mode that compiles .el files when they are loaded
  ;; using `load' or `require'.
  (compile-angel-on-load-mode 1))
```

### Doom Emacs

Here is how to install *compile-angel* on Doom Emacs:

1. Add to the `~/.doom.d/packages.el` file:
```elisp
(package! compile-angel)
```

2. Add to the top of `~/.doom.d/config.el`:
```elisp
;; Set `compile-angel-verbose' to nil to disable compile-angel messages.
;; (When set to nil, compile-angel won't show which file is being compiled.)
(setq compile-angel-verbose t)

;; Uncomment the line below to compile automatically when an Elisp file is saved
;; (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook #'compile-angel-on-save-local-mode)

;; The following directive prevents compile-angel from compiling your init
;; files. If you choose to remove this push to `compile-angel-excluded-path-suffixes'
;; and compile your pre/post-init files, ensure you understand the
;; implications and thoroughly test your code. For example, if you're using
;; the `use-package' macro, you'll need to explicitly add:
;; (eval-when-compile (require 'use-package))
;; at the top of your init file.
(push "/init.el" compile-angel-excluded-path-suffixes)
(push "/early-init.el" compile-angel-excluded-path-suffixes)

;; A global mode that compiles .el files when they are loaded
(compile-angel-on-load-mode 1)
```

3. Run the `doom sync` command:
```
doom sync
```

### Spacemacs

To install **compile-angel** in Spacemacs, you need to distribute the configuration across three specific sections of your `~/.spacemacs` file to ensure the loading order mimics the vanilla Emacs instructions.

#### 1. Add the package

Locate the `dotspacemacs-additional-packages` variable and add `compile-angel` to the list:

```emacs-lisp
   dotspacemacs-additional-packages '(
     ;; ... other packages ...
     compile-angel
   )

```

This ensures Spacemacs downloads and installs the package.

#### 2. Configure pre-load variables

The variables that must be set **before** packages load should be placed in the `dotspacemacs/user-init` function.

```emacs-lisp
(defun dotspacemacs/user-init ()
  "Initialization for user code:
This function is called immediately after `dotspacemacs/init', before layer configuration."

  ;; Ensure Emacs loads the most recent byte-compiled files.
  (setq load-prefer-newer t))

```

#### 3. Configure the package

Place the package configuration in the `dotspacemacs/user-config` function.

```emacs-lisp
(defun dotspacemacs/user-config ()
  "Configuration for user code:
This function is called at the very end of Spacemacs startup, after layer configuration."
  (use-package compile-angel
    :demand t
    :config
    (setq compile-angel-verbose t)

    ;; Uncomment the line below to compile automatically when an Elisp file is saved
    ;; (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook #'compile-angel-on-save-local-mode)

    ;; The following directive prevents compile-angel from compiling your init
    ;; files. If you choose to remove this push to `compile-angel-excluded-path-suffixes'
    ;; and compile your pre/post-init files, ensure you understand the
    ;; implications and thoroughly test your code. For example, if you're using
    ;; the `use-package' macro, you'll need to explicitly add:
    ;; (eval-when-compile (require 'use-package))
    ;; at the top of your init file.
    (push "/init.el" compile-angel-excluded-path-suffixes)
    (push "/early-init.el" compile-angel-excluded-path-suffixes)

    (compile-angel-on-load-mode 1))
)

```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Should files be compiled every time Emacs starts? How can I determine why compile-angel compiled a file?

The `compile-angel-on-load-mode` does not recompile packages every time Emacs starts; it only compiles a file when its `.el` source has changed.

To determine why an Emacs Lisp file was compiled, add the following to your init file **before** enabling `compile-angel-on-load-mode`:

```elisp
(setq compile-angel-debug t)
```

Then restart Emacs and switch to the `*compile-angel:debug*` buffer. If `compile-angel` triggered the compilation, the buffer will indicate the reason. If you believe a file was compiled incorrectly, please consider [submitting an issue](https://github.com/jamescherti/compile-angel.el/issues) including the relevant lines from the `*compile-angel:debug*` buffer.

### What are some interesting Emacs customizations to consider alongside compile-angel?

Below are a few interesting options:

```elisp
;; Ensure that quitting only occurs once Emacs finishes native compiling,
;; preventing incomplete or leftover compilation files in `/tmp`.
(setq native-comp-async-query-on-exit t)
(setq confirm-kill-processes t)

;;
;; Keep `native-comp-jit-compilation`. However, uncomment the following if Emacs
;; JIT native compilation should be disabled and completely replaced with
;; compile-angel. This can prevent redundant or repetitive background
;; compilations.
;;
;; (setq native-comp-jit-compilation nil)
;; (setq native-comp-deferred-compilation native-comp-jit-compilation) ; Deprecated

;; The following enables compilation of packages during installation;
;; compile-angel will handle it.
(setq package-native-compile t)

;;
;; The following disables compilation of packages during installation;
;; compile-angel will handle it.
;;
;; (setq package-native-compile nil)
;; (setq straight-disable-native-compile nil)  ; straight.el users
;; (setq straight-disable-compile nil)  ; straight.el users

;; -------------------------------------------------
;; Show buffer when there is a warning.
;; (NOT RECOMMENDED, except during development).
;; -------------------------------------------------
;; (setq compile-angel-verbose t)
;; (setq compile-angel-byte-compile-report-issues t)
;;
;; (setq warning-minimum-level :warning)
;; (setq byte-compile-verbose t)
;; (setq byte-compile-warnings t)
;; (setq native-comp-async-report-warnings-errors t)
;; (setq native-comp-warning-on-missing-source t)
```

### How to exclude certain .el files from compilation in compile-angel?

You can exclude .el files from compilation by adding path suffixes to the `compile-angel-excluded-path-suffixes` list.

For instance, the following excludes any path that ends with `suffix.el` (or its variations, such as `/path/ANYTHINGsuffix.el.gz` or `ANYTHINGsuffix.el.gz`) and exactly matches paths that end with `/filename.el` (including their variations, like `/filename.el.gz` or `ANYTHING/filename.el.gz`).

```elisp
;; Run the following before enabling `compile-angel-on-load-mode'
(push "suffix.el" compile-angel-excluded-path-suffixes)
(push "/filename.el" compile-angel-excluded-path-suffixes)

;; Run here: (compile-angel-on-load-mode)
```

If a path suffix in `compile-angel-excluded-path-suffixes` ends with `.el`, `compile-angel` will automatically exclude the `.el.gz` variant of that file. For instance, specifying `suffix.el` will also exclude `suffix.el.gz`.

### How to exclude custom-file, recentf, savehist files?

You can exclude the custom-file, recentf, and savehist files using the following code snippet:
``` emacs-lisp
;; Exclude the custom-file, recentf, and savehist files
;;
;; Ensure that compile-angel is loaded using `require`, `use-package`, or
;; another package manager, as compile-angel-excluded-path-suffixes is declared after
;; the package is loaded.

;; Ensure that the value of `savehist-file` is updated before proceeding
(with-eval-after-load "savehist"
  (push (concat "/" (file-name-nondirectory savehist-file))
        compile-angel-excluded-path-suffixes))

;; Ensure that the value of `recentf-save-file` is updated before proceeding
(with-eval-after-load "recentf"
  (push (concat "/" (file-name-nondirectory recentf-save-file))
        compile-angel-excluded-path-suffixes))

;; Ensure that the value of `custom-file` is updated before proceeding
(with-eval-after-load "cus-edit"
  (when (stringp custom-file)
    (push (concat "/" (file-name-nondirectory custom-file))
          compile-angel-excluded-path-suffixes)))

;; Enable the (compile-angel-on-load-mode) mode after the above
```

### How to enable or disable byte compilation and native compilation?

You can control whether *compile-angel* performs byte compilation or native compilation of your .el files by setting the following variables in your configuration:
- **`compile-angel-enable-byte-compile`**: Set this variable to `t` to enable byte compilation. When enabled, *compile-angel* will generate .elc files for your .el files, making them load faster by converting them into bytecode. Set it to `nil` to disable byte compilation.
- **`compile-angel-enable-native-compile`**: Set this variable to `t` to enable native compilation, which generates machine code for supported systems, further improving performance. Set it to `nil` to disable native compilation.

Example configuration:
```emacs-lisp
;; Enable both byte compilation and native compilation (default)
(setq compile-angel-enable-byte-compile t)
(setq compile-angel-enable-native-compile t)
```

### Excluding specific files and directories using helper functions

If you need to prevent **compile-angel** from compiling specific files or entire directories, you can use the provided helper functions. These functions automatically handle path expansion, symbolic link resolution, and regular expression formatting, ensuring your paths are excluded correctly.

* Use the `compile-angel-exclude-file` function to exclude a single file:
  ```elisp
  ;; This adds exact match regular expression to the
  ;; `compile-angel-excluded-path-regexps' variable
  (compile-angel-exclude-file "~/.emacs.d/init.el")
  ```

* Use the `compile-angel-exclude-directory` function to exclude a directory and all of its contents:
```elisp
;; It ensures the path is treated as a directory and adds a prefix match regular
;; expression to the `compile-angel-excluded-path-regexps' variable
(compile-angel-exclude-directory "~/.emacs.d/local-packages/")
```

NOTE: Both functions check if the expanded path differs from its `file-truename` (for example, if symlinks are involved in the path). If they differ, both the expanded path and the `file-truename' are added to the exclusion list to guarantee the file or directory is consistently ignored during compilation.

### What's the point of using compile-angel? My Emacs compiles packages automatically anyway!

Emacs often skips the compilation of certain Elisp files. To verify this:

- Install `compile-angel`,
- Enable verbose mode: `(setq compile-angel-verbose t)`
- Enable the mode: `(compile-angel-on-load-mode)`

Observe whether `compile-angel` compiles any Elisp files (you will see "Wrote" `.elc` files in the `*Messages*` buffer). If it does, this indicates that Emacs missed compiling those files and that `compile-angel` can help improve the performance of your Emacs.

### Could compiling all Elisp files not be accomplished with a script? (e.g., a GNU Parallel along with Emacs's -batch mode.)

Compiling a large number of Emacs Lisp files regardless of their actual usage is inefficient.

One of the advantages of *compile-angel* is that it compiles files when they are loaded, restricting the compilation process to only what is necessary and as a result significantly reducing compilation time.

Moreover, *compile-angel* guarantees that all relevant files are transparently both byte-compiled and native-compiled without requiring the user to invoke any scripts manually, which simplifies maintenance and reduces the risk of outdated files.

(If you are interested in compiling all Emacs Lisp files regardless of their actual usage, the author recommends trying [elispcomp](https://github.com/jamescherti/elispcomp), which performs precisely that task. However, *compile-angel* offers greater efficiency.)

### Why not just use the package-recompile-all function?

The *package-recompile-all* function is effective for recompiling files within packages, but it misses other files that are not part of a package.

In the *compile-angel* author's configuration, for example, *package-recompile-all* skipped most of the local packages loaded using *use-package* with *:ensure nil* or *require*. Additionally, *package-recompile-all* does not compile transparently; the user must manually run it and wait for it to complete.

The *compile-angel* package, on the other hand, transparently compiles all packages without any user intervention. The user simply needs to enable *(compile-angel-on-load-mode)*.

### What is the impact on Emacs startup?

Compile-angel is optimized. It is fast enough that it is nearly imperceptible to the user. The author of compile-angel reports an Emacs startup time of 0.25 seconds with compile-angel enabled and 0.23 seconds without it. Feel free to share your own benchmarks.

### What's the difference between native and byte compiled?

Byte compilation translates Elisp code into an intermediate bytecode .elc that is faster to load than .el files.

Native compilation goes a step further by converting this bytecode into machine code, which is directly executed by the CPU without the need for an interpreter. Native compilation significantly improves performance.

### What are some use-cases of compile-angel?

Emacs often misses the compilation of certain Elisp files.

One of the author's primary use cases involves maintaining numerous Emacs packages, which are synchronized into `~/.emacs.d` using automation scripts and `rsync` for testing during development. The author appreciates how compile-angel automatically compiles the files synchronized to the `~/.emacs.d` directory while working on these packages.

There are many other use cases as well. For example, some Emacs users prefer storing packages locally or in GitHub repositories, periodically updating them using `git pull`. This approach is often adopted for packages that are no longer actively maintained, enabling users to manage them independently. In such cases, compile-angel can seamlessly handle both byte-compiling and native-compiling these packages whenever local modifications are made.

### What is the difference between auto-compile and compile-angel?

Compile-angel offers more features and is more optimized than auto-compile (see details below).

The *compile-angel* author was previously an *auto-compile* user but encountered an issue where several Elisp files were not being compiled by auto-compile (see the explanation below), resulting in Emacs performance degradation due to the lack of native compilation.

The author of auto-compile has made some decisions that prevent it from guaranteeing that all .el packages are byte-compiled and native-compiled. For example, if the user deletes all the .elc files or if the .el files have never been compiled before, auto-compile won't recompile them. Here is a quote from Jonas Bernouli, aka *u/tarsius_*, the auto-compile author ([from this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1gmmnhn/comment/lwhtte2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)):
> Both [autocompile] modes only ever re-compile a source file when the
> respective byte code file already exists but is outdated. Otherwise
> they do not compile the source file. By "otherwise" I mean if:
>   - The *.elc exists but is newer than the corresponding *.el, OR
>   - The *.elc does not exist.
> In both cases the source file is not compiled, by design.

Here are additional features provided by compile-angel that are not available in auto-compile:

- Compile-angel ensures that even when when the .elc file doesn't exist, the .el source file is compiled. Auto-compile, on the other hand, requires (by design, as explained above) an existing .elc file in order to compile.
- Compile-angel ensures that files are compiled before and/or after they are loaded, In addition to compiling the `.el` files loaded using *load* and *require*, also handles files that auto-compile misses, using the `after-load-functions` hook. This ensures that all files are byte-compiled and native-compiled.
- Compile-angel can exclude files from compilation using regular expressions in *compile-angel-excluded-path-regexps*.
- `compile-angel` can exclude files from compilation based on path suffixes listed in `compile-angel-excluded-path-suffixes`. This list contains path suffixes such as `("loaddefs.el" "/cus-load.el" "/charprop.el")`, which excludes any path ending with `loaddefs.el` (or its variations, such as `loaddefs.el.gz`) and exactly matches paths ending with `/cus-load.el` and `/charprop.el` (including their variations, like `/cus-load.el.gz` and `/charprop.el.gz`). If a path in `compile-angel-excluded-path-suffixes` ends with `.el`, it will automatically exclude the corresponding `.el.gz` variant when Emacs is configured to load `.el.gz` files.
- Compile-angel provides options to allow enabling and disabling specific functions that should be advised (load, require, etc.).
- Compile-angel allows enabling debug mode, which allows knowing exactly what compile-angel does. Additionally, compiled files and features are stored in variables that help identify what was compiled.
- *compile-angel-on-save-mode* supports compiling indirect buffers (clones).
- *compile-angel-on-load-mode* compiles features that have already been loaded to make sure that they are compiled.
- Compile-Angel can use caching to enhance performance when locating the .el file corresponding to a given feature. Auto-compile does not compile features.
- Supports both Vanilla Emacs and Doom Emacs. For Doom Emacs, compile-angel ensures that the Doom Emacs user directory, Emacs directory, and modules directory are excluded from compilation. This is essential because .el files in these directories must not be compiled, or Doom may fail to load them correctly.
- compile-angel-on-load-mode performs native compilation only when Emacs fails to do so. Explanation: When JIT compilation is enabled, loading a .elc file automatically triggers native compilation, making Emacs load the native-compiled version asynchronously and replacing the auto-compiled functions. (However, auto-compile disables native compilation by default, causing Emacs to skip native-compiling some files, even in save mode. When enabled, auto-compile compiles files before loading, but Emacs will still recompile them after loading the .elc file.)
- Compile-Angel checks for unbalanced parentheses before compiling a file in save mode, without altering the cursor position, making it less intrusive than the default check-parens used by auto-compile.
- Compile-Angel double-checks after packages are loaded to ensure that Emacs properly performs native compilation when JIT is enabled, as Emacs sometimes skips native-compiling .elc files that should be JIT compiled.
- Prevent `byte-compile-file` from displaying Wrote messages in the *Messages* buffer unless `compile-angel-verbose` customization is set to `t`.
- It has the ability to skip compiling features provided by Emacs core without associated Elisp files (e.g., pgtk, w32, lcms2, kqueue, emacs, mps, etc.). This includes features provided directly by C code as well as features provided by core Elisp that don't have their own .el files. These features are excluded from compilation attempts since they have no source files to compile.

### How to compile Emacs for Performance on Linux and Unix systems?

Most Linux distributions ship generic binaries compiled to run safely on a vast array of older hardware configurations. While this ensures broad compatibility, it sacrifices the speed that comes from using the specific, modern instruction sets of your processor. Compiling Emacs directly from source allows instructing the compiler to generate machine code targeted at your CPU architecture, resulting in a faster and more efficient runtime environment.

Beyond raw hardware optimization, building from source enables dropping decades of legacy compatibility layers and embracing modern desktop technologies. For example, Wayland users can configure the build to bypass old X11 display protocols in favor of a Wayland environment, ensuring smoother rendering and better system integration...

After that, the same keys work consistently across all supported major and minor modes, providing a unified and predictable folding experience.
- [buffer-guardian.el](https://github.com/jamescherti/buffer-guardian.el): Automatically saves Emacs buffers without requiring manual intervention. By default, it triggers a save when the user switches to another buffer, switches to another window or frame, Emacs loses focus, or the minibuffer is opened. Beyond standard file buffers, *buffer-guardian* also manages specialized editing buffers such as *org-src* and *edit-indirect*. Additional features, disabled by default, include periodic or idle-time saving of all buffers, automatic exclusion of remote, nonexistent, or large files, and support for custom exclusion rules via regular expressions or predicate functions.
