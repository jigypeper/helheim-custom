;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.
;;
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The core functionality for multiple cursors. The code is inspired by
;; `multiple-cursors.el' package from Magnar Sveen.
;;
;; How multiple cursors works internally. Command is firstly executed for
;; real cursor by Emacs command loop. Then in `post-command-hook' it executed
;; for all fake cursors. Fake cursor is an overlay that emulates cursor and
;; stores inside point, mark, kill-ring and some other variables (full list
;; is in `hel-fake-cursor-specific-vars'). Executing command for fake cursor
;; looks as follows: set point and mark to positions saved in fake cursor
;; overlay, restore all variables from it, execute command in this environment,
;; store point, mark and new state into fake cursor overlay.
;;
;; Each command should has `multiple-cursors' symbol property. If it is
;; `t' — command will be execute for all cursors. Any other value except
;; `nil' — it will be executed only once for real (main) cursor. If
;; `multiple-cursors' property is `nil' i.e. absent user will be prompted
;; how execute this command and choosen value is permanently stored in
;; `hel-whitelist-file' file.
;;
;; ID 0 is always corresponding to real cursor.
