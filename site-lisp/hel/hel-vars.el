representing a narrow space. Recommended candidates are:
- ?\\u2000 EN QUAD (default value)
- ?\\u2002 EN SPACE
- ?\\u2009 THIN SPACE

The appearance depends heavily on:
1. Your main font.
2. The font Emacs selects for this narrow space — it should be
   a variable-pitch font. Use `describe-char' to verify the chosen font.

Note: This all is a hack since Emacs can't render two characters in one
cell. The bar fake cursor character is virtually inserted between cells,
shifting subsequent content to the right."

  "Association list with (KEY . SPEC) elements for Hel surrounding functionality.

This variable is buffer-local so that users can modify it from major-mode hooks.

KEY is a character, SPEC is a plist with following keys:

`:pair'    Cons cell (LEFT . RIGHT) with strings, or function that returns such
         cons cell. The strigs that will be inserted by `hel-surround' and
         `hel-surround-change' functions.

`:lookup'  Any of:

         1. Cons cell with strings (LEFT . RIGHT), or function that return
            such cons cell. LEFT and RIGHT should be patterns that will be
            used to search of two substrings to delete in `hel-surround-delete'
            and `hel-surround-change' functions. If not specified `:pair' value
            will be used.

         2. Function that returns list with 4 positions:

                     (LEFT-START LEFT-END RIGHT-START RIGHT-END)

            of START and END of LEFT and RIGHT delimeters.
            Example:
                       LEFT                              RIGHT
                     |<tag> |Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet| </tag>|
                     ^      ^                          ^       ^
            LEFT-START      LEFT-END         RIGHT-START       RIGHT-END

Following keys are taken into account only when `:lookup' argument is a cons
cell with strings (LEFT . RIGHT) or a function, that returns such cons cell.
If `:lookup' is a function that returns list with 4 positions, they will be
ignored.

`:regexp'    If non-nil then LEFT and RIGHT strings specified in `:lookup' will be
           treated as regexp patterns. Otherwise they will be searched literally.

`:balanced'  When non-nil all nested balanced LEFT RIGHT pairs will be skipped.
           Otherwise the first found pattern will be accepted.

See the default value for examples.")
