representing a narrow space. Recommended candidates are:
- ?\\u2000 EN QUAD (default value)
- ?\\u2002 EN SPACE
- ?\\u2009 THIN SPACE

The appearance depends heavily on:
1. Your main font.
2. The font Emacs selects for this narrow space — it should be
   a variable-pitch font. Use `describe-char' to verify the chosen font.

Note: This all is a hack since Emacs can't render two characters in one
cell. The bar fake cursor character is virtually inserted between cells,
shifting subsequent content to the right."

   `:insert'    Cons cell (LEFT . RIGHT) of strings, or a function that returns

2. What \"md\" (`hel-surround-delete') and \"mr\" (`hel-surround-change') will remove.

   `:balanced'  When non-nil, skip all nested balanced LEFT/RIGHT pairs.
