;;; Commentary:
;; This package provides helper functions to delete and rename buffer files:
;; - bufferfile-rename: Renames the file visited by the current buffer and
;;   updates the buffer name for all associated buffers, including clones and
;;   indirect buffers. It also ensures that buffer-local features referencing
;;   the file, such as Eglot, are correctly updated to reflect the new file
;;   name.
;; - bufferfile-delete: Delete the file associated with a buffer and kill all
;;   buffers visiting the file, including clones/indirect buffers.
;; - bufferfile-copy: Copies the file visited by the current buffer to a new
;;   file.
;;
;; (The functions above also ensures that any modified buffers are saved prior
;; to executing operations like renaming, deleting, or copying.)
